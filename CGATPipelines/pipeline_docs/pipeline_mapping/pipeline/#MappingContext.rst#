Mapping context
===============

This section summarizes the genomic context that reads have mapped
to. This section serves as a rough indicator to where reads have
aligned too. The counting is naive:

* Counts are in terms of alignments. Thus a single read might
  contribute several counts to the same context or different contexts.

* Some genomic contexts can be overlapping, thus some alignments might
  be counted several times.

* An alignment needs to map to a context over at least 50% of its
  bases.  Thus some alignments spanning several contexts might be
  dropped.

Context results
===============

The following table lists all genomic contexts that reads map to. 

.. report:: Mapping.MappingContext
   :render: table
   :force:

   Number of alignments that align in a certain genomic context

Ribosomal and Repetitive RNA expression
=======================================
Ribosomal RNA is one of the most abundant transcripts in a cell
and dominates RNASeq samples until it is removed. The following
plots and tables examine the number of alignments to ribosomal
and repetitive RNA. Repetetive RNA annotation is taken from the
UCSC repeatmasker tracks.

.. report:: Mapping.MappingContext
   :render: table
   :slices: total,RNA,rRNA,scRNA,snRNA,srpRNA,tRNA,ribosomal_coding

   Number of alignments that align to ribosomal and repetitive
   RNA annotations (from the UCSC repeatmasker track)

.. report:: Mapping.MappingContext
   :render: pie-plot
   :pie-first-is-total: other_mapped
   :groupby: track
   :slices: total,RNA,rRNA,scRNA,snRNA,srpRNA,tRNA,ribosomal_coding
   :layout: column-3
   :width: 200

   Proportion of alignments that align to ribosomal and
   repetitive RNA annotations (from the UCSC repeatmasker track)

Protein coding expression
=========================

The following plots list the number of alignments to protein
coding and (protein coding) pseudogene exons. The annotations are
taken from the ENSEMBL gene set.

.. report:: Mapping.MappingContext
   :render: table
   :slices: total,protein_coding,pseudogene

   Number of alignments that align to protein coding genes or pseudo
   genes.

.. report:: Mapping.MappingContext
   :render: pie-plot
   :pie-first-is-total: genomic
   :groupby: track
   :slices: total,protein_coding,pseudogene
   :layout: column-3
   :width: 200

   Proportion of alignments that align to protein coding genes or
   pseudo genes.
