Assessment of sample grouping
=============================

This section contains plots to assess sample grouping. 

It is important to assess if samples group by experiment, treatment, or replicates 
to assess if there could be sample switches (e.g. from misslabelling during experiment)
or batch effects that might outweigh treatment effects in the downstream analysis.
