CGATPipelines |version| - NGS and Genomics pipelines
==================================================================

This document brings together the various pipelines and scripts
written before and during the `CGAT Training Programme`_. This
documentation has two parts. Below is the general documentation
covering the complete code collection.

Overview
========

The CGAT pipeline collection has grown out of the work in comparative
genomics by the `Ponting
<http://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/group-leaders/chris-ponting>`_ group in
the last decade. Now, the `CGAT Training Programme`_ has added
functionality for next-generation sequencing analysis (NGS).
