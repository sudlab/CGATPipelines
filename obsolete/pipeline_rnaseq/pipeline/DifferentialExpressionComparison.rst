=======================
Overlap between methods
=======================

This section compares the results of various methods to predict differential 
expression.

All comparisons are on the gene level, which might not be the best choice
for all methods, for example :term:`cuffdiff`.

.. Shared genes
.. ============

.. The following table lists the number of shared predictions in each
.. gene set.

.. .. report:: DifferentialExpression.DifferentialExpressionOverlap
..    :render: table
..    :groupby: all

..    Number of shared predictions between different methods.

.. Fold change
.. ===========

.. .. report:: DifferentialExpression.DifferentialExpressionCorrelationFoldChange
..    :render: r-smooth-scatter-plot
   
..    Scatter-plots of fold change estimates

.. P-values
